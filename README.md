#  JavaScript Demos - Dedicated for Learning Database

This is a repo for database learners to learn concepts such as buffer replacement, ARIES logging and recovery protocols with interactive visualization demos. Ideally, these demos can help demonstrate these concepts in a graphical way with a clear step-by-step process. Just download, install and enjoy it !
